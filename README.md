# Data Science Profile
This code helps generate a Data Science profile as described in "Doing Data Science" by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt.  They say that a Data Scientist usually has skills in many different areas, specifically Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Machine Learning, Communications, Visualization, and Domain Expertise.  I think these naturally group together as follows:
* Mathematics & Statistics
* Computer Science & Machine Learning
* Communciation & Visualization
* Domain Expertise

The authors also mention (and I agree!) that you don't have to be good at all of these.  Rarely does this "unicorn" exist that is a master of all seven.  In practice, Data Science teams are assembled to complement each other's skillsets and round out the teams Data Science profile.

My Data Science profile (as generated by this code) is given below.
